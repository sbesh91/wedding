          When are RSVPs due?
          <span>
            Please RSVP by XX/XX/XXXX to make sure we save your seat! If you can’t make it, please let us know. If we don’t hear from you, we’ll just assume you hate us.
          </span>
        </h4>
        <h4>
          Can I bring my kids?
          <span>
            Only kids at heart! Trust us, we love your kids, but we want you to party with us without having to keep track of your kids all night (you totally deserve a break). And we’re not providing babysitters at the venue.
          </span>
        </h4>
        <h4>
          Is there a shuttle to and from the hotel and ceremony?

        </h4>
        <h4>
          Can I bring a date?
          <span>
            If your invitation says “and Guest,” feel free! If not, we can’t afford to feed an extra person, so they’ll have to stay home.
          </span>

        <h4>
          What's the dress code?
          <span>
            Suggestions for Ladies: dress, skirt and a nice top, dress pants and a blouse, dressy jumpsuit, you get it. Look fabulous (but not as fabulous as Ashley!)
            <br/>
            Suggestions for Men: suit and tie, slacks and button up, clean pants and your best collared shirt that doesn’t have a stain on it... good enough!
            What Not to Wear:
            <br/>
            1. Obviously, don’t wear white 
            <br/>
            2. Jeans and T-shirts are a NO and leave those cargo shorts at home!! 
            <br/>
            3. Don’t dress like you’re going out to the club 
            <br/>
            4. Our bridesmaids are wearing long, wine/burgundy colored dresses and the groomsmen are in blue suits, so it would be best to try not to match them!

          You said you don’t want gifts, but...?
          <span>
            If it’s a handmade gift or something super special and personal, we’d love it! If it’s a plain old gift from a store, we’d rather you donate toward our European excursion. And if you can’t afford a gift, we totally understand. It means more to us that you can just spend the evening with us.
